# pilotfish macOS and Linux Plugin beta install

> This experimental beta targets macOS and Linux. Linux requires Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, or Alpine Linux 3.19+ and an otherwise-working officially supported Claude Code installation, per the [official system requirements](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup#system-requirements) (checked 2026-08-22). macOS with Claude Code 2.1.239 is live-observed. Linux is contract-qualified only; it has not been tested, verified, or live-observed. Windows is excluded. SessionStart hooks are required for ambient activation. This beta does not claim stable reliability, cross-version compatibility, or runtime namespace-collision proof.

The Plugin and the legacy global install must not coexist. The Plugin hook fails closed when the effective user `CLAUDE.md` contains canonical pilotfish markers or the known legacy policy header: it emits no policy and tells you to migrate.

## Preflight

Run this copy-paste POSIX `/bin/sh` preflight. It executes `claude --version`, accepts a numeric `X.Y.Z` first token only, and requires Claude Code 2.1.219 or newer. That floor is newer than the verified baseline that enforces agent `tools` allowlists; do not install a prompt-only approximation because the read-only `plan-verifier` and `security-reviewer` roles depend on those allowlists.

It also rejects a non-empty `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` without printing its value because that variable overrides every agent `model` frontmatter. Unset it yourself and rerun rather than letting an installer silently change the caller's environment.

The same preflight resolves the effective user configuration root and checks for a legacy global policy without printing `CLAUDE.md`. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` must be absolute when non-empty; otherwise Claude Code uses `$HOME/.claude`.

   ```bash
   pilotfish_plugin_preflight() {
     if CLAUDE_VERSION_OUTPUT=$(claude --version 2>/dev/null); then

   Continue only after the command prints `No legacy global pilotfish policy detected.` Any other result is fail-closed.

## Migrate from global v1

The easiest path is to let Claude Code perform the migration from a reviewed,
local pilotfish checkout. Start Claude Code in that checkout and paste:

```text
Read install/PLUGIN-INSTALL.md and install/AGENT-INSTALL.md in this checkout.
Migrate my existing global pilotfish v1 installation to the user-scope
pilotfish Plugin, following those runbooks exactly.

Resolve the effective Claude configuration root and run the read-only
preflight. Show me the resolved root, proposed timestamped backup path, and
exact files and settings you will change, then ask for one approval. After
approval, create and read-back verify that backup. If any required backup copy
or verification fails, stop before removing or installing anything. Only after
the verified backup succeeds, remove the legacy pilotfish policy block,
unmodified pilotfish agent files, and settings attributable to that install;
preserve every unrelated setting and file. If an agent file was customized or
ownership is ambiguous, stop and show me the difference instead of deleting it.
Re-run preflight, install pilotfish@pilotfish at user scope, verify the installed
Plugin, and tell me to restart Claude Code. Do not print credentials or install
the Plugin alongside any remaining legacy policy.
```

The AI should need only that one write approval unless it discovers customized
or ambiguous legacy state. The manual equivalent follows.

Back up the effective configuration before removing anything:

```bash
set -eu

```

Continue only if the backup block exits `0`. If any copy or read-back verification fails, stop before legacy removal or Plugin installation and leave the original configuration unchanged. Then follow the [legacy uninstall procedure](./AGENT-INSTALL.md#uninstall): remove only the matching pilotfish agent files, the single `pilotfish:begin/end` block, and settings values attributable to that install. Preserve user-customized files and unrelated settings. Re-run the preflight check above; continue only after it prints the no-legacy diagnostic.

## Choose the main model before installation

The Plugin does not edit `settings.json`. Before running the install commands, repeat this check inside every project where the Plugin will run: use `/status` to identify active managed, local (`.claude/settings.local.json`), project (`.claude/settings.json`), and user settings, then confirm the effective model picker exposes every shipped role-model alias—`"opus"`, `"sonnet"`, and `"haiku"`.

User, project, and local `availableModels` arrays merge and deduplicate. Evaluate their effective non-managed union first. Only when that union omits a shipped alias should the user explicitly approve appending each missing alias to one appropriate editable scope while preserving every existing entry; do not duplicate an alias already supplied by another scope. Managed policy is highest priority and can enforce a strict `availableModels` allowlist that lower scopes cannot loosen; if it excludes any shipped alias and an administrator cannot change it, stop. See the [official settings precedence](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/configuration#settings-precedence). Any effective model set that omits a shipped alias does not establish the advertised tiering.

Then make one explicit user-approved main-model choice and use `/status` inside every intended project to confirm the effective main model is Opus:

1. **Persistent:** merge `"model": "opus"` into the highest-priority editable scope that currently sets `model`—local, project, or user—while preserving every other key. If no editable scope sets `model` and no managed selection blocks persistent setup, explicitly approve creating or merging `"model": "opus"` in the user `$CFG/settings.json`. A lower-priority user setting does not override a project or local model selection. A managed non-Opus `model` remains the startup default, so this option alone does not establish persistent Opus selection.
2. **Per session:** leave persistent settings unchanged and launch every pilotfish session explicitly with `claude --model opus`. Model selection is a documented key-specific exception to generic settings precedence: `--model` overrides a `model` value from any settings file for that session. It remains constrained by managed `availableModels` and organization model restrictions, so the common effective-scope checks above still apply. See the [official model configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config) and [command-line override behavior](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/configuration#the-command-line-overrides-your-files-for-one-session).

Stop only when managed `availableModels` or another organization restriction prevents selecting Opus, or when `/status` does not confirm an effective Opus main after the chosen setup. Do not silently mutate configuration. If the user keeps a non-Opus main model, the Plugin may still install and load, but the advertised Opus-main tiering is not established.

## Install at user scope

For the current marketplace branch:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add --scope user alexeynesteruk/pilotfish
claude plugin install --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
```

For a reviewed immutable release, replace `X.Y.Z` with one version and pin the marketplace to that exact repository tag:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add --scope user alexeynesteruk/pilotfish@vX.Y.Z
claude plugin install --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
```

Review and accept the declared SessionStart hook if Claude Code prompts. Restart Claude Code; installation alone does not activate the hook in the current process.

## Update

If you installed the mutable current marketplace branch:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update pilotfish
claude plugin update --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
```

If you pinned an immutable release, `marketplace update` intentionally stays on that tag. To move to reviewed release `vX.Y.Z`, replace the registered tag explicitly:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
claude plugin marketplace remove --scope user pilotfish
claude plugin marketplace add --scope user alexeynesteruk/pilotfish@vX.Y.Z
claude plugin install --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
```

Restart Claude Code after either path. Updating the marketplace does not update the installed Plugin by itself.

## Disable or re-enable

```bash
claude plugin disable --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
# restart Claude Code

claude plugin enable --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
# restart Claude Code again
```

Disable/enable state takes effect in a new Claude Code process. A disabled hook is not a security boundary; do not reinstall the legacy global policy alongside it.

## Uninstall

```bash
claude plugin uninstall --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
claude plugin marketplace remove --scope user pilotfish
```

Restart Claude Code. The first command removes the installed Plugin; the second removes its marketplace registration.

## Manual rollback

For the first Plugin-capable release, rollback means removing the Plugin and marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
claude plugin marketplace remove --scope user pilotfish
```

Restart Claude Code. If you need the legacy global installation again, restore only the reviewed backup made during migration by following the legacy runbook; never run both installation methods together.

From the second Plugin-capable release onward, choose a prior `A.B.C` release whose root `vA.B.C` and Plugin `pilotfish--vA.B.C` tags identify the same reviewed pilotfish version. Then reinstall from that immutable root tag:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
claude plugin marketplace remove --scope user pilotfish
claude plugin marketplace add --scope user alexeynesteruk/pilotfish@vA.B.C
claude plugin install --scope user pilotfish@pilotfish
```

Restart Claude Code. Do not combine a root release tag with a differently versioned Plugin tag.

## Troubleshooting

If startup shows this diagnostic, the hook intentionally emitted neither its sentinel nor policy:

```text
pilotfish Plugin blocked: legacy global pilotfish detected. Follow https://github.com/alexeynesteruk/pilotfish/blob/main/install/PLUGIN-INSTALL.md#migrate-from-global-v1 to migrate, then restart Claude Code.
```

Use the effective config root from Preflight, back it up, complete the legacy uninstall, and restart. A relative `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, missing absolute `HOME`, unreadable `CLAUDE.md`, or config-probe error also blocks policy emission until corrected.

Every SessionStart also rechecks `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`. If it is non-empty, the hook prints no value, sentinel, or policy; unset it in the launching environment, then restart or relaunch Claude Code.
